    Notes:

    duration_in_months is implemented with the days360 function.
    The days360 function has some properties that introduce complexities to the calculation.
    for example:
    * days360(datetime.date(2022,2,1), datetime.date(2022,2,28)) == 27
    * days360(datetime.date(2022,2,1), datetime.date(2022,3,1)) == 30
    the effect is that the actual calendar duration of days doesn't increase in a perfectly linear way
    with the duration_in_months, and sometimes two different date ranges evaluate to the same duration:
    1. duration_in_months(datetime.date(2022, 2, 1), datetime.date(2022, 2, 28)) == Decimal('1')
    2. duration_in_months(datetime.date(2022, 2, 1), datetime.date(2022, 2, 27)) == Decimal('0.9')
    3. duration_in_months(datetime.date(2022, 2, 1), datetime.date(2022, 2, 26)) ==
       Decimal('0.8666666666666666666666666667')
    4. duration_in_months(datetime.date(2022,1,1), datetime.date(2022,1,30)) ==
       duration_in_months(datetime.date(2022,1,1), datetime.date(2022,1,29))

    In case 4, when two date ranges have the same duration_in_months, we want to return the
    longest possible duration. This will resolve the ambiguity in the applicant's favor, as
    this function is used to calculate the last valid end_date for the benefit.
