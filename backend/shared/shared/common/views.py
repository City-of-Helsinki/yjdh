    A view that changes on-the-fly between the real and mocked view based on

    otherwise as real_view_class.as_view(**initkwargs) where mock_view_class and

    For reference see django.views.generic.base.View.as_view:
    https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/3.2.x/django/views/generic/base.py#L49

    The double underscore prefixes for variables/properties are used to invoke name
    mangling to avoid name clashes with the enclosed View classes, see PEP8:
